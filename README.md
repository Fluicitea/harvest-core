# Harvest Core
Minecraft library mod for primarily adding new harvest levels.

Can add harvest levels before, between, and after harvest levels, for both vanilla Minecraft and Tinkers' Construct. These harvest levels can be added by multiple mods without conflicts; if multiple mods add the same harvest level, the first mod in the load order that adds the harvest level will have that harvest level shifted to the right (one higher harvest level) by the next mod in the load order, and so on.

This mod also doubles as the main library mod for other ShadowVappy mods.
